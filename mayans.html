            The Mayans are a Native American civilization introduced in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors. They focus on archers.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Mayans specialize in foot archers and have a robust economy. Situated in Central America, they were best known for their mysterious disappearance around 900 and their ability to build a great civilization in a tropical rainforest climate. The Mayans were resourceful and were able to utilize a variety of natural resources. Examples include limestone for construction, the obsidian for tools and weapons, jade and quetzal feathers used in the elaborate costumes of Maya nobility as well as marine shells, which were used as trumpets. To reflect this achievement, their resources last longer while their unique technologies El Dorado and Obsidian Arrows boost their Eagle Warriors and Archer line. The main force of the Mayan army was archers, and they used them extensively. As a result, their unique unit is the Plumed Archer, a fast archer with a small attack bonus against infantry as well as featuring superior armor and hit points.

            <p>
            As a Native American civilization, the Mayans lack any form of cavalry and gunpowder. As a replacement, they get the Eagle Warrior which also gets a massive HP boost with El Dorado. Overall, their archer and infantry departments are strong with access to everything that does not ride a horse or wield a firearm (bar the Champion). Their siege weapons miss the Siege Onager, but they get the Siege Ram and Heavy Scorpion. On the water, they have a complete tech tree (apart from the Cannon Galleon, naturally). Their Monks are average. Their defensive structures are overall strong and the same goes for their economy.
