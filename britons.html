            The Britons are a Western European civilization in Age of Empires II. They represent the English and the Anglo-Normans during the High to Late Middle Ages, with a focus on foot archers.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Britons' unique unit is the Longbowman, from their historical use of the English Longbow in their campaigns. Longbowmen are archers with higher range than every other archer in the game, even outranging Castles and towers in later stages of the game. Their Castle Age unique technology Yeomen refers to the fact that the Britons heavily relied on archery, thus giving their foot archers even more range, as well as increasing their tower damage. The Britons were known for their small villages scattered across England, as well as their tactics of encroaching on enemies with strongholds, and thus get cheaper Town Centers. Known as skilled shepherds and heavily involved in the wool trade, British shepherds work faster. For a time in England, all sports but archery were banned on Sundays, thus the Britons also have faster Archery Ranges.
            </p>
            <p>
            Their descendants are the modern English nation, that alongside the Scottish, Welsh and Irish nations (descendants of the Celts). These nations created a united kingdom, the British civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Britons' main advantages are in their ranged units as they arguably have the best foot archers. They are trained faster and have a very long range. Their infantry is also very good with a complete tech tree. But their mounted units are very underwhelming and their siege weapons are also lacking. This is compensated to a degree by their very dangerous Trebuchets that aim at units with perfect accuracy and deal blast damage thanks to Warwolf. Their navy is strong with a full tech tree apart from Elite Cannon Galleons. The Monks are below average with three technologies missing. The defensive structures are good, and their economy rather average, although their Shepherd bonus is very helpful early on.
