        Boom or fast fortress (FF) refer to an economic boom, a strategy where the player focuses almost exclusively on their economy instead of investing resources for military purposes. It is commonly used to counter the Turtle strategy as a boom economy can very easily outperform a turtling economy in the late game. Due to their lack of focus on rapid military development, they are extremely susceptible to a rush. Booming is a late game strategy that is best used when a map makes it difficult to attack without higher tech units.

        A booming player will typically have a weak military at first, investing the bare minimum in military in order to survive while powering economy as much as possible. A boom typically has a goal that, when reached, will start rapid military production in order to catch up to and eclipse opposing forces. This often coincides with a specific technology, unit availability, or threat level of opposing forces. A specific type of boom may sometimes be referred to by its resource type or the location of resources. Fish boom (maps with water, but only fish) and Water Boom (maps with water, fish and Whales) are common usages.

        The most important aspect of booming is Villager count, which is derived from Town Center production and food availability. Since, in all but the most unusual cases, food availability is a constant for any competent player, the most important factor is Town Center production time. The player is limited to one Town Center until the Castle Age, meaning that getting to Castle Age with the resources to build extra Town Centers and maintain Villager production is key to a strong boom. Typically, this means using starting 200 stone to build two additional Town Centers immediately on hitting Castle Age, after having tuned economy to have sufficient wood and food to maintain Villager and Farm production. The booming phase ends when sufficient additional Villagers are produced to start military production without cutting Villagers, and the boom is successful once the game-state stabilizes with the booming player having a larger economy.

        Boom strategies actually take longer to get to the Feudal Age, but then reach the Castle Age almost immediately after, stopping only long enough to build prerequisite Feudal Age buildings. Imperial Age is optional, usually being completed early if against an opposing boom strategy. Against more aggressive opponents, its common to stay in Castle Age for much longer in order to stabilize the game-state.
