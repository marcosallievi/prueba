        Turtle strategies typically involve the massing of armies and/or economies behind fortifications. "Turtling" is most common counter to rushes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Whether or not a player turtles depends on certain factors, such as the stage of the game, and the civilization's bonuses. Also, it depends on whether the map features enough chokepoints, to minimize the cost in stone of defensive structures.
        </p>
        <p>
        Either way, players that intend to turtle should gather as much stone as possible, as apart from the walls and towers themselves, their unlocking researches (accessible from the Granary) also cost stone. It is also imperative to research Architecture as quickly as possible, as the hit points of structures are increased, whereas the build time is decreased.
        </p>
        <p>
        The utility of turtling inevitably diminishes when siege weapons start rolling on the field, especially Heavy Catapults, but it can still be useful when preparing to build a Wonder, with the defensive structures existing to delay the enemy for as long as possible, until it stands for two thousand years, and the player wins the game.
        </p>
        <p>
        Building walls and towers can significantly impede rushes by the enemy in the Feudal Age and even in the Castle Age walls can slow down an enemy with siege. However, in the Imperial Age the tree-clearing Siege Onager and powerful anti-building weapons such as Trebuchets and Siege Rams become available, reducing the impact of defensive structures and causing the best defense to be good offense. Therefore, turtling should be used only early game to defend from a rush while you build for the later stages of the game which require more offense.
        </p>
        <p>
        The effectiveness of turtling largely depends on the map, with closed maps such as Yucat√°n favoring this strategy while open maps such as Arabia have the opposite effect.
        </p>
        <p>
        Turtling works best with defensive civilizations such as the Byzantines, who have one of the strongest walls in the game and the highest HPS for buildings, as well as having access to all defensive buildings such as the entire Watch Tower line, and the Bombard Tower, as well as their powerful castles. It also works great with Teutons, who have +3 range for their castles, as well as having all defensive structures in their tech tree.
