            The Goths are a Central European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on infantry.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Goths were a collection of Eastern Germanic tribes that constantly warred with the Roman Empire during its later years, known for bringing Rome to its knees and traveling all over Europe, bringing devastation with them. Following the fall of the Empire, the Goths divided into the Ostrogoths (East Goths) who settled in Italy, and the Visigoths (West Goths) who settled in the region that would later become Portugal and Spain. The leaders of the Goths and their Age of Empires II equivalents were the Huskarls, the Gothic unique unit.
            </p>
            <p>
            As the Goths were known for their raiding prowess, the medium infantry Huskarls have high pierce armor and shrug off damage from fortifications. This also makes them very powerful against archers, and they also move quick enough to chase them down. The Goths were known as flexible nomads with mostly nonexistent formal government, so their first unique technology Anarchy allows their leaders, the Huskarls, to be trained at the Barracks like normal infantry, as early as the Castle Age.
            </p>
            <p>
            Their second unique technology Perfusion allows them to train infantry extremely fast. As the Goths were known for being able to mass soldiers very quickly, they are able to spam more units already available to all civilizations, thanks to their infantry costing less as they advance to Feudal Age and their Barracks naturally working faster. As raiders, Gothic infantry get extra attack bonus against buildings. Being nomads gave them other distinct advantage: their Villagers can hunt bigger game effectively and carry more meat. Finally, the Goths get a higher population limit to reflect their ability to field armies quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
            They are one of the ancestors of the Spanish and Portuguese civilizations. Hence, this is most likely why the Goths have access to gunpowder units such as Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons since both the Portuguese and the Spanish used gunpowder in warfare to expand their empires (although this can also be for gameplay balance purposes since the Goths have a lackluster Siege and Archery unit line).
            </p>
            <p>
            The Goths are an infantry civilization. As a result, infantry is the way to go since the Goths' advantages predominantly lay there. The main advantages there are the fast creation speed and low cost which offset lacking Plate Mail Armor by far. The Goths have weak archers, but they can fully upgrade their Skirmishers and Hand Cannoneers. The cavalry branch is not very prominent with the Goths albeit being overall acceptable, featuring Hussars with Bloodlines, but lacking Paladins and Plate Barding Armor. The Siege Workshop is also average without Siege Rams and Siege Onagers. Siege Engineers are also not available, but the Goths primary raiding units are Huskarls, anyway, so this is not that much of a drawback. Their navy is fairly useable, but Dry Dock is missing, so their ships lack speed. The Gothic Monks are way below average, missing four out of ten technologies, and their defenses are downright abysmal. Their economy is good, however.
            </p>
            <p>
            Summing it all up the Goths may seem a civilization below average, but their infantry rushing capabilities make up for their overall lacking tech tree and are feared for a reason.
